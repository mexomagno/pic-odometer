# PIC Odometer

Old project from around 2013.

A little odometer based on the PIC12F675 chip.
Written on Assembly as at the moment, available free compilers were super inefficient, and the odometer behavior was simple enough.

This is one of my first electronics projects, everything was soldered onto a little cardboard rectangle with some holes on it. But it worked! And I took it on a [120km cyclothon from Santiago, Chile to Valpara√≠so](https://www.bicicosas.cl/cicletada-a-lo-vasquez-todo-lo-que-necesitas-saber/) and impressively worked perfectly the whole trip! 

**Watch it working [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR1bMufbfTI)**.

## Todo:
- [ ] Add schematics
- [ ] Translate comments to english
- [ ] Some pictures?
- [ ] Some pictures of it working on the trip?
